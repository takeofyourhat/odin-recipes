This project is a starting point for creating beautiful websites and apps in the future, specifically it will be a website using only HTML about a recipe, not a food recipe but one for creating a magical hat.

With this project i want to put in practice what i learned about HTML: 
-boilerplate setup
-elements and attributes
-heading and paragraphs
-linking to other websites or images 
-lists
-correct commiting
